# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a Python ROS2 engine implementation with comprehensive documentation and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Key Knowledge
- Using MkDocs with Read the Docs theme for documentation
- Documentation source files are in `docs/` directory
- Documentation is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions to https://yhbcode000.github.io/python-ros-engine/
- Mermaid.js is used for creating diagrams in documentation (version 10.9.4)
- Custom CSS file at `docs/custom.css` improves wide screen layout with max-width: 1200px
- Project uses pre-commit hooks that may cause issues with commits

## Recent Actions
- Configured MkDocs to use Read the Docs theme instead of Material theme
- Added custom CSS to improve wide screen layout support
- Integrated Mermaid.js support for creating diagrams in documentation
- Added project structure diagrams to both README.md and docs/index.md
- Fixed Mermaid syntax errors by updating from `graph` to `flowchart` keywords
- Implemented custom HTML template approach to improve Mermaid compatibility with Read the Docs theme

## Current Plan
1. [IN PROGRESS] Fix remaining Mermaid rendering issues with Read the Docs theme
2. [TODO] Test local documentation server with corrected Mermaid integration
3. [TODO] Verify online documentation deployment through GitHub Actions
4. [TODO] Continue adding more comprehensive documentation content and examples
