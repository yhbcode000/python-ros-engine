# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To implement a Python ROS engine that can handle various message types and translate between Python ROS and native ROS messages.

## Key Knowledge
- The project is built using Python with dataclasses for message definitions
- Uses pytest for testing with 89 total tests across multiple test files
- Message types include primitives (Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, Float32, Float64, Bool, Empty), time-related types (Time, Duration), and multi-dimensional array types (ByteMultiArray, Int8MultiArray, etc.)
- The message translator functionality converts between Python ROS engine messages and native ROS messages
- Fixed serialization/deserialization issues for nested objects in multi-array messages by updating the Message class and all multi-array message classes to properly handle reconstruction of nested dataclass objects from dictionaries
- All tests are currently passing, indicating a stable implementation

## Recent Actions
- Successfully implemented all message types with proper serialization/deserialization support
- Fixed critical serialization issues for nested objects in multi-dimensional array messages
- Verified message translator functionality for converting between Python ROS and native ROS messages
- Completed comprehensive testing including publisher/subscriber and service/client communication
- Ran all tests to confirm 89/89 tests are passing

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Implement all primitive message types
2. [DONE] Implement time-related message types
3. [DONE] Implement multi-dimensional array message types
4. [DONE] Fix serialization/deserialization for nested objects
5. [DONE] Implement message translator functionality
6. [DONE] Verify publisher/subscriber communication
7. [DONE] Verify service/client communication
8. [DONE] Run comprehensive integration tests
9. [DONE] Confirm all 89 tests are passing
